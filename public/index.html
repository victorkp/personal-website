                   <p>He started developing Android applications with Android's inception, even though he was not even a high school student. For the past two years, Victor has been working on Android systems and applications for embedded devices and wearables.</p>

                   <p>As for intellectual property, in addition to the software he published on the market and the code he released as open source, Victor is the author of a Elementary Android App Development, a book aimed at thoroughly covering the basics of Android applications.</p>
                    
                   <p>In high school, he developed a novel means of feature detection in images, designed to leverage the abilities of low power, multicore systems. In November 2015, he was granted <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US9195901B2">US Patent 9195901B2</a>.</p>

                <h2>DriveSafe LLC</h2>
                <p>The brainchild of Jake Steinerman, and a project that I joined in order to occupy my time. DriveSafe was one of the first apps to make use of the Google Glass GDK. When we saw articles about DriveSafe in PCWorld, Wired, and even the print-version of USA Today, we knew we were onto something important.</p>

                <p>Thanks to DriveSafe, Jake and I were invited to give courses at the Wearables Devcon and the Mobile+Web Devcon in 2014. DriveSafe is an ongoing project, with some large updates on the way. In late September, DriveSafe strategically partnered with Tranztec Solutions and was exhibited at an automotive technology tradeshow. </p>

                     <h2>Exlon Algorithm (Patented)</h2>
                     <p>An algorithm I designed while a high school Junior. The Exlon algorithm is a rethinking of feature detection in images. It is focused on taking full advantage of multi-core configurations by being highly parallelized. For this reason, on embedded systems with slow-speed multi-core processors, the Exlon algorithm tends to be significantly faster than traditional methods.</p>

The book includes plenty of sample code, and explains everything from "Hello, World" to interface design, to multithreading. </p>

                    <p>A research project I worked on under the direction of Proffessor Janne Lindqvist. The goal of this project was to construct an algorithm that shows thatsimply knowing one's instantaneious speed along a driving trip (not GPS data) is enough to predict where one is driving. Our Elastic Pathing paper was a Best Paper Nominee at Ubicomp 2014, and we are working on a journal submission now.</p>

                     <h2>GlassAuth and GlassSettings</h2>
                     <p>The GlassAuth library was the first OAuth sign in implementation for Google Glass - released months before Google's own implementation. GlassAuth has been shown and mentioned at wearable technolgoy conferences by myself and other presenters</p>

                     <p>GlassSettings is a library that is able to quickly and easily build preference screens that hook into Android's SharedPreferences for Google Glass. It comes with several built in preference types: including checkboxes, selecting from a list, measuring head tilt, and voice input. Additional types of preferences can be easily created by implementing a simple abstract class.</p>
                     <p>The GlassAuth library is on GitHub <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/victorkp/GlassAuth">here</a></p>
                     <p>A sample application using GlassAuth (including a server) is <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/victorkp/GlassWebNotes">here</a></p>

                <h2>BadgIn Attendance Tracker</h2>
                <p>A time clock for the modern era! BadgIn was a project intended for my own use that tried to solve the problem of taking attendance at recurring club meetings. Members were issued NFC (tap-and-go) cards; in order to sign in and out, all they had to do was tap their card on the back of a Nexus 7 set up at the door.  </p>
                <p>Additionally, BadgIn can display detailed attendance statistics, export attendance data as a spreadsheet, and even automatically backup to Dropbox.  </p>

                     <p>I was looking for a quick way to send emails (preferably from the command line). Disappointed I didn't find anything along the lines of what I wanted, so I began working on Kaiser. Kaiser is a command-line Gmail client written completely in Perl. Although it is not the most feature-packed email system, it has basic functionality such as sending mail, writing drafts, reading messages, and the ability to switch among multiple accounts. Kaiser was designed to run on RedHat systems, although changing the dependencies can allow it to run on Debian as well.</p>
                     <p>Kaiser can be found on <a target='_blank' href="https://www.github.com/victorkp/kaiser-gmail-client">GitHub</a></p>

                 <p>After the success of my talks at the Wearables DevCon in 2014, I was invited back to speak again at the slightly rebranded Wearables TechCon in March 2015 in Santa Clara.</p>
                 <p>I gave two talks, the first was regarding building a POV video streaming service for smart glasses and other heads-up displays; this talk highlighted some of the specific issues (battery life, heat) that make a video streaming application difficult on a wearable, as well as some general tips for how to get a prototype up and running quickly. The second talk demonstrated and explained unifying a UI across Google Glass and Android Wear. The session gave example use cases for why one would want to present UI elements on different screens simultaneously, as well as example source code for such an application. </p>

              <p>After the Wearables Devcon 2014, Jake Steinerman and I were recommended by one of the keynote speakers to give a talk at the Mobile+Web Devcon in Chicago. Being that this conference was much less Google Glass focused, our presentation was primarily about the challenges when designing applications for Glass and some of the issues with the platform.</p>

               <p>Thanks to the good publicity of DriveSafe, Jake Steinerman and I were invited to give a couple of talks related to Google Glass application design and development at the Wearables Devcon in San Francisco. </p>
               <p>Our first talk involved sensor usage on Glass - more specifically some of the quirks of the system. In addition to general sensor usage, we examined a means of getting data from the IR eye sensor, which is not officially present in the APIs. Our second talk was regarding my GlassAuth library's implementation of OAuth on Google Glass. Both talks were very well received by their respective audiences.</p>
